The idea is to develop a material for a course in Oceanographic Data Analysis and Modelling.

## Justification

Programming is becoming an essential tool for most of the research in oceanography. With global numerical simulations down to submesoscale and higher-resolution observations, processing and analyzing big data in oceanography is only possible by coding the analyses by yourself and making use of top-level tools and parallel processing in collaborative platforms. Many under/graduate courses have tried to overcome this gap in their programs by integrating computational science into their main curriculum. The lack of resources in developing country institutions unbalance the opportunities in this area, but there are many open-source and cloud tools that could be used to introduce students to this new world. The language barrier is another problem. Most of the programming tutorials are in English, with pratically no online course for oceanographic data analysis in Portuguese and other languages. How can we overcome the language and technological barriers and give developing-country students the opportunity to learn programming data analysis? There are multiple answers to this question, but collaborative learning is usually the way to develop the independence of the students in their own learning process.

## The project

The subject covers acquiring, presenting, and analyzing the most common types ofobservational data and model output, such as Argo floats, satellite-derived sea-surface temperature, altimetry, moored data, CTD casts, and general circulation models. This course is designed to provide enough experience for the students to learn how to read, understand and plot time series, profiles, cross-sections, maps and do analyses using the top-level module formulti-dimensional data, the xarray project. The main objective is to give enough experience with the main tools and develop the self-awareness and independence of the students in their own learning process.
